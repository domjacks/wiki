# Audio Fundamentals


## Mono, Stereo, Surround

### 5.1

6 audio channels with 1 channel per speaker.

Speakers arranged in a circle.

### Dolby Atmos

New method of creating and playing audio content. Instead of 1 channel per speaker, Atmos arranges sound into objects with each object being assigned a place. 

This allows for a more immersive experience including the ability to have spatial accuracy and represent 'height' e.g. a helicopter could be heard flying 'above' you and into the right corner instead of simply from left to right like 5.1 would do.
