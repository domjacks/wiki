# Video Fundamentals

## Scanning methods

Interlaced vs. Progressive

## Frame Rate

50Hz vs 60Hz

## Aspect Ratios

- 16:9
- 

## Resolutions

### SD

- 720 x 480

### HD & FHD

- 1280 x 720
- 1920 x 1080

### UHD

- 3840 x 2160 (4K)
- 7680 x 4320 (8K)

> Technically 4K was first coined as a cinema standard of 4096x2160, but the 4K referred to in TV terms is 3840x2160.

## Colours and Contrast

Where increasing the number of pixels is a common way to try and increase quality, improving the pixels themselves can often lead to better perceived quality. 

### Dynamic Range

Dynamic range in video essentially means the range of contrast available for each pixel. Essentially, how much light each pixel should put out. This is called luminance.
 
#### High Dynamic Range

Previously, video signals had a limited range of contrast available to them.

HDR allows for darker blacks and lighter whites causing more depth to images.

There are many competing standards for HDR: HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG

##### HLG

Hybrid Log Gamma

##### Dolby Vision

Propriety format from Dolby. It utilises dynamic metadata, meaning it can adjust the luminance for each scene (or even frame).

Both a device and content has to be certified in order to be classified as Dolby Vision capable. Dolby works with TV manufacturers and content providers to also set some static metadata to tailor the experience.

##### HDR10 

### Colour Gamut

Colour gamut is the range of colours available for each pixel. This is called chromacity.

#### WCG 

Wide Color Gamut.

Increases range of colors than the standard.

Allows for "redder" reds and "greener" greens.

> Often found with HDR, but it is not necesarily linked.

### Specifications

The two main specifications are BT.709 and BT.2020.

Both these specs contain information regarding the dynamic range and colour gamut that should be available. 

> DCI-P3 is another spec which is used for cinema
