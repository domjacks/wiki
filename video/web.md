## Elements

### HTMLMediaElement

Foundation element used for basic media-related capabilities. Both the HTMLVideoElement and HTMLAudioElement inherit from this element.

> NOTE: Some browsers implemented specific streaming protocols built directly into the media elements themselves. For example, [if you passed a DASH manifest as the source to a video element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/DASH_Adaptive_Streaming_for_HTML_5_Video#using_dash_-_client_side), it would parse that and stream accordingly. 
> This functionality is fragmented and thus a solution like MSE is now the preferred approach (see below).
