# Fundamentals

The web can be described as many things depending on who you're asking. From a developer point of view, the "web platform" can be thought of as a set of standards alongside a set of browser implementations.

## Web Standards

There are a few main standards bodies curating the various specs that make up functionality on the web. 

WHATWG publishes both the HTML and DOM specs. Alongside some other specs such as Fetch, File System, Web Sockets etc.

The W3C publishes a lot of other specs such as CSS, Media Source Extensions, Service Worker and lots of other smaller APIs and features that are allowing the web to become more powerful. They organise themselves into Working Groups and Interest Groups such as the MediaWG and the 

And lastly, the Javascript and JSON specs are published by the ECMA organisation.

There are also a bunch of other standards bodies that aren't web specific but still form a part of the functionality of the web. These includes bodies such as ISO (eg. JPEG), iETF (HTTP) and Unicode.
