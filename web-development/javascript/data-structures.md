# Data Structures

Data Structures in JavaScript are all just Objects with some special bits.

## Indexed

### Arrays

Arrays are indexed collections. They are just objects with a specific structure such as integer-keyed properties, a length property and some convenient methods such as push() and indexOf(). 

They can hold data of multiple types (including expressions) 

Array methods:

* `push()`
* TODO - add more array methods

### Typed Arrays

There are also typed arrays which are essentially syntactical sugar over data buffers to make them look like arrays.  

e.g.

* Int8Array 
* Uint8Array
* Float32Array
* BigUint64Array 

## Keyed

TODO - Fill in details for each below

### Map
### WeakMap
### Set
### WeakSet
