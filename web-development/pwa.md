# Progressive Web Apps

Progressive web app is a term used to describe applications that utilise a specific set of features which enable it some extra features on user's devices. 

Traditionally, web applications have struggled to compete on feature-parity with native applications. The technologies underlying PWAs aim to bridge that gap. 

Where the web has been very successful is the reach it can provide. The combination of reach and features stands PWAs in very good stead when compared to traditional web applications and native applications. 

PWAs are often described as:
- Capable
- Reliable
- Installable
